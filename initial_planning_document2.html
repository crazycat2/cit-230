<p><h1>Peer Feedback</h1>
<p>Here is what Brittany Remington commented:</p>

<p>
I like your grid-based layout; it flows. Your medium site layout is particularly unique. I never would have thought to place the weather data on the left and nav/footer content on the right. You think outside of the box, literally!   (no one's ever told me that! :3)
</p>
<p>
Based on the feedback I received from Sister Kath on my own sketches, it sounds like she would like us to specify where we will be placing the data, such as temperature high/low, precipitation, wind, etc. She also said to be more specific about what goes into the header, navigation, and footer areas. So, I might suggest you expound on that portion of your sketch. For example, what goes in the "options" section?
</p>

<p>Kathy Walker asked," How did you make your drawings?" </p>
<p>I replied, "paint"</p>
