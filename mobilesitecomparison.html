    <h3><br>Finding Content </br></h3> good, could be even more organized as I noticed they added some social networking buttons
    <h3><br> Clarity of text,images, and media </br></h3> clear
    <h3><br> Navigation </br></h3> hard on phones
    <h3><br> Colors and layout </br></h3> nice colors and fonts, maybe minimalistic
    <h3><br> Likes and dislikes </br></h3> constant thumbing down to navigate, good layout
